  <p class="indent">I'm Mihir Korupolu, and am really interested in expanding my knowledge in the fields of mathematics, biology, and chemistry. These subjects have always been extremely interesting and after being introduced, I have been extremely passionate about them. I intend to take classes such as AP Calculus AB, AP Biology, and AP Chemistry to supplement my learning and take me to the next level.
  </p>
  
  <p class="indent">Some of the most important characteristics that are required in all three of these fields are the ability to express thoughts clearly and determination to accomplish goals. As both an ARC tutor as well as a teacher's assistant at Siliconandhra, I can confidently say that I am able to help others learn by communicating effectively. My work at the ARC and as a TA consists of providing support to students and helping them excel.
    </p>
<p class="indent">I am a very hardworking and dedicated student, and I am always willing to learn and grow. As a victor of the North California Youth Competition and an employee of PEL Learning Center in San Ramon, I've built the determination to achieve my goals as well. All in all, I hope to be a worthy candidate and I thank you for your time.
